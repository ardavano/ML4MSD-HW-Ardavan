## What I Actually Learned from the Paper

### 1. Completeness is Actually a Big Deal

The paper has these examples showing that even fancy descriptors like symmetry functions can give you the SAME features for DIFFERENT structures. That's interesting. It means your ML model literally cannot tell them apart, no matter how good it is.

### 2. Why There Are Many Different Descriptors

The lecture showed us this hierarchy of descriptors and I got a bit confused. But the paper explains they're not just random choices. They're different solutions to the same problems with different trade-offs. For example, Coulomb matrix is super fast but not smooth; but Symmetry functions are Smooth and fast, but maybe incomplete. Finally, SOAP are more complete, but slower to compute. As I understood from paper it's not that one is "better" it depends what you really need. For quick screening of thousands of materials, compositional descriptors are fine. For accurate energies, you need the expensive structural ones.

### 3. The History
Reading section 2 about how descriptors evolved helped me understand why we use what we use. In the old way (1990s-2000s) they tried to fit molecular PES for specific small molecules. It worked great for H₂O or small reactive systems but it couldn't transfer to anything else.
The turning point that happened in 2007 by Behler-Parrinello. They showed you could use local atom-centered features which suddenly could do bigger systems and you could transfer learning between similar molecules. In our days, now, Graph Neural Networks learn their own features. GNN are most flexible but still use ideas from traditional descriptors (like locality).

### 4. What "Smooth" Really Means

I thought smoothness just meant "no sudden jumps." But the paper shows it's more subtle. You need smooth DERIVATIVES too, not just smooth values. This matters because ML models (especially neural networks) use gradients. If your feature has discontinuous derivatives, the gradients during training are messed up. This is why when we used sorted Coulomb matrix, it worked okay for predictions but probably would've had issues if we tried to optimize structures using forces (which need derivatives).
